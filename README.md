# App-Sleeper
Limit the power of apps to dedicate more to a specific resource as well as reduce overall power consumtion and internet usage.

This app currently reads CPU usage only. 

Future functionality will be the implementation of sleeping or shutting down the PC when a process is no longer using the CPU at a high rate.
A timer may also be added to control when the program should stop functioning. 

Improvements will be made to the code, mostly in the CPU readings. Prior to waking the app up I will wait some time and check the CPU status again to ensure there was not an issue with the monitored software.

I will be adding the functionality to add multiple apps in to be exluded from the sleep by use of the GUI.
